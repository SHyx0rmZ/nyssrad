1. INTRODUCTION
--------------------
nyssrad is a fast and simple key-value database. You don't need SQL 
statements to get data and set data ("NoSQL"-database). You can think
of nyssrad as a redis-clone. 

nyssrad does not provide complex database structures, stored procedures
or anything a "real" DBMS provides. Instead, it provides a small and
fast API and simple methods to set values with a key and to get them.


2. REQUIREMENTS
--------------------
All requirements are listed in the file DEPENDENCIES. You need at least
node.js and npm. Also, you should have the permission to create a
socket under the port 8888.


3. USAGE
--------------------
After running "make" and installing all missing dependencies you can
run "./nyssrad" from the bin directory. After a successful start up
you get a prompt "> ". Now you can either set and get values from
the command line:

    > set hello world
    true
    > get hello
    world
    > set foo bar
    true
    > get foo
    bar
    > get hello foo
    world
    bar

Or you can open your browser and set and get values via the URL:

    http://localhost/set/hello/world

    http://localhost/get/hello

To mark a key-value pair as "final" (not changable), add "true" as a
third parameter for set:

    > set hello world true
    true
    > get hello
    world
    > set hello foo
    false

As you can see, nyssrad returns either true when a operation was 
successful, false when a operation was not successful or the value
associated with a key.

Hint: nyssrad returns the results via http as application/json.
If you want other formats use one of the APIs to access nyssrad.


4. API
-------------------------
nyssrad provides a simple and clean API for several languages.
In the directory api/ you can find all supported languages.

Important: If you want to use the JavaScript API make sure you
have nyssrad_proxy.php as well shipped with your solution.

 
5. CONTRIBUTION
-------------------------
If you have any suggestions or bug reports, send them
to derhartmut@niwohlos.org. If you have patches, send them as git-patches
to the same address.

If you have written a API in a new language send all files or at
lest a link to your repository/website where others can find
your API.
