nyssrad's dependencies
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

nyssrad has some dependencies. To easily check if they're met, run
        
        make 

at the toplevel directory. It will run the script 

        prereq.pl 
        
and check for everything it needs and install it if desired.

Of course, the minimal requirements you have to met to run the setup
are:

        make (GNU make and other derivates should work)
        perl (everything above version 5 should work)
