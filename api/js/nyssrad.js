/**
 * This is a simple and example API for using nyssrad.
 * For the future I will provide APIs in many different languages
 * (for each language an own repo).
 *
 * The API let you send a request and store a key as well as getting
 * a value from a given key or many values stored in a JSON object.
 *
 * To avoid having too many dependencies we will use the good old
 * XMLHttpRequest object instead of f.e. jQuery for AJAX calls.
